                <p class="description">Before you begin working on a website, it is helpful to know what your clients and future users are looking for. User interviews are helpful in that aspect to get a better idea of what to include in a website. In this case, the website was a personal website and portfolio to showcase my work and who I am to recruiters and the general public. In my user interviews, I asked a lot of questions about what kind of content was the most appealing, questions to get to know the user and questions about what they wished to present to employers/recruiters.

                <p class="description">Another way to get a sense of what content would be best for a website is through competitor analysis. By looking at what your competitors (similar websites) are doing, you can get a good idea of what should and shouldn’t be in your final design. For my competitor analysis, I mainly looked at both individual designer websites, as well as portfolio networks like Behance. This was because I wanted to be inspired by the competitors I analyzed and I wanted to see the content they had on their sites. Similarly, I looked at the portfolio networks to see what they were lacking as a designer’s only online portfolio.

                <p class="description">Once you have some idea of what you want to include in your website, it’s important to start putting all those ideas down somewhere. A feature value matrix is a good way of outlining this information in a straightforward manner while thinking about the importance of each feature. I came up with a list of 15 features with associated values. Most, if not all, of these features were inspired by competitors websites, where they were all recurring features I was seeing.

                <p class="description">Feature prioritization is important to do before starting work on a project. For my portfolio I prioritized features that had the most value, as defined in the feature value matrix. I also prioritized features that ultimately got to the root of what was important to a personal website and portfolio. Ultimately the highest priority features were those that especially helped show who I was personally and as potential employee.

When conducting my cognitive walkthroughs I did not face too many challenges and many of my participants had ease with performing tasks. The most difficult task of conducting the cognitive walkthrough might have been if I had to repeat myself or any of the tasks.

For the user tests I did a 5 second test and a questions test. I wanted to focus on the design of my portfolio more than anything and what made an impression on the users. One challenge I found was that the tests were, ironically, not responsive for mobile and I had some users message me about having difficulty using the tests on their phone. I got a lot of great feedback on the design, both positive and negative, with many positive responses about the design and simplicity, and the negative responses being about the lack of color and excessive whitespace.

        <p class="heading">summary of findings</p>
        <p class="description">
            Through my user research and testing I gained a lot of important insight into the creation of my personal website/portfolio. During user research I learned a lot about the basic content I should include in my portfolio. During the competitor analysis I was able to see that most of the competitor portfolios had the same basic content, such as examples of work, contact information, and descriptions of work. Seeing that solidified that I would need to include these features in my portfolio. This part of user research also helped me figure out the kind of design I wanted for my website as well. During feature prioritization, I was able to narrow down the most important features to include in my portfolio. This made the development process a lot easier because I knew exactly what I was including and had also made a good wireframe design. Despite this, implementing all these elements cohesively into the design was still a challenge. In some areas, like the contact information I had trouble figuring out the best way to include the feature in a way that went well with my design. In other areas, like the examples of work, I had challenges with implementing features where my content was lacking.
        </br>
    </br>

The user research helped me figure out what to include in my portfolio website, while the user testing helped me understand where I needed to improve upon my design and interface. I originally thought the overall design of my website was a strong point of my portfolio because of the clean and minimalistic style I had seen from competitors. However, through testing I found that some people did not like this and thought it was boring or had too much white space. I also found that most people had a good impression of the first page of my website. The cognitive walkthrough, on the other hand, helped a lot in my understanding of how users might navigate my website. It seemed that most people did not have any challenges in navigating my site or finding my contact information. However, I wish I had more time to test with the mobile website.

                <p class="heading">incorporation of findings</p>
        <p class="description">

My findings from the user testing provided a lot of important insight into how I could improve the design of my website. I plan to improve upon the general design by addressing the comments about how there was a lot of whitespace or it was plain by incorporating color or illustration somehow. I think this will also help demonstrate my skills as a designer by having my own illustrations or designs incorporated within my own portfolio. I also plan to play around with the fonts a little bit more so everything is not so plain. I think by improving upon the designs in this way I’ll be able to show more of my personality through the design, rather than the content. In terms of design, I also plan to fix the Resume page on my website, since during the cognitive walkthrough some people did not like how the resume page was literally just a link to the pdf. I plan to embed the resume within my website somehow, while also still providing a downloadable link.
</br></br>

I plan to improve my portfolio by adding more and improving content to my projects section and being more clear about my roles in those projects I mention. I also got a lot of feedback on how small the text was. In sections like the project page where the description obviously has a lot of text, I can understand how small text could become a problem. I plan to change my breakpoints a little so that the text isn’t as small across devices. Overall, I also plan to fix some of the code in my breakpoints so that users on all devices are getting a good experience with my website.
